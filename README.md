# Experiment: Sticky notes in Riot.js
Trying out [Riot.js](https://riot.js.org) and [HTML5 Drag API](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/DragEvent) to create sticky notes.

Outcome: Not successful, [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505521) prevents me from using `ondragend`. Will probably not continue with other approaches/workarounds like mouse events.
